# EV Charging Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This repository contains a group project that applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging schedules. The primary objective is to manage charging times effectively to reduce grid congestion and improve overall energy efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Model**: Utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn optimal charging strategies.
- **Simulation Environment**: Developed a simulated environment to train and evaluate the RL model.
- **Performance Metrics**: Assessed the model's effectiveness in reducing peak demand and balancing load.
